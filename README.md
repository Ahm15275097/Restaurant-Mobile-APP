# "World Cuisine" -  A Restaurant's Mobile Application

## Project Overview

A mobile application has been designed and created to compliment a restaurant chain. Its purpose is to showcase the food available, to display the food menu, and allow customers to order food for collection or for delivery, as well as contact the restaurant chain via email, telephone or direct messaging through the application itself.

The target audience for the restaurant itself is from 5-11 for the kid's menu, and 12+ for the full menu, but for the application itself, 16+ because people above that age have full responsibility over what they can buy, and are eligible to work in the UK.

The name of the restaurant chain that has been created is "World Cuisine" due to its unique selling point: The restaurant serves food from many different countries and cultures around the world.

The application itself will have a main focus which is the basis of its design being a clear, friendly and 'easy-to-use' user interface. The ideas of empty space, clear fonts, simple English and other languages being implemented and a logical layout will be used throughout the design of the application.

Feasibility Studies have been conducted for all five studies which support the overall idea and motive behind the application (as well as the restaurant chain itself):

 - Technical Feasibility
 - Operational Feasibility
 - Schedule Feasibility
 - Economic Feasibility
 - Go-to-market feasibility

The application will be implemented using a third party mobile application builder, then placed into at least both of Apple's "App Store" and Google's "Play Store", but will be illustrated through paper for the low-fidelity designs and marvelapp.com for the high-fidelity designs.

The user requirements for the application are:

 - The application must be free
 - It should have a clear and cohesive design
 - The application must be easy to use
 - It must support all of the major languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese, French, German, Russian, Dutch)
 - It should allow the user to view all of the menu items
 - It should allow the user to contact the restaurant chain at any time via mobile, email or an inbuilt form
 - It must allow customers to order food for collection or for delivery

The money funding the application comes from the profits made by the restaurant chain itself.

We would be using the programming language java to create the application. There are many
reasons why this language would be chosen. Firstly, Java is highly secure as there is no threat no
threat to the security because nothing gets executed outside the JVM. This is essential for our
application as we would be taking user payments and therefor the application needs to be highly
secure and robust. It also helps us as developers as they are regularly updated and maintained by
oracle. This is useful as we can regularly add new features which improves the whole look of the
app. On the application we can have a form for the user, here we can receive user requests on what
they would like us to improve on. This cost would involve us paying for the running of the cost and
this would be around the £1000 a year.

### Target Audience and User Persona

World Cuisine's target audience as a resturant is non specific to age or gender. While the application is accessable for everyone, it is targeted more towards the age range of 16+ as those under this age are not likely to be able to pay themselves. 
The application will also be widely accessable to users of other languages, and disabled users. For instance, those with loss of hearing can order through the app without having to talk through the phone, as well as being able to select delivery for those who cannot leave their homes as easily as others.

Name: Archie Frank
Age: 20
Occupation: Full time employee
Background: As a new full time hire, Archie does not have a lot of free time to be able to go out and eat at resturants or even cook. Through the easy use of the World Cuisine application, Archie can easily order to his house or office when he likes.

Name: Sian Blodwyn
Age: 53
Occupation: Self employed
Background: Sian has suffered from a bad hip and has recently had surgery to replace it. This has impacted everyday activies, one of which being able to go out for a meal. Through the use of the application Sian can order food as often as she wants within the comfort of her own home.


## Problem: Definition and Solution

The restaurant is growing in popularity, more and more customers are coming into the shop every
day. Some of these customer do not eat in the restaurant and prefer to do a take way. To make it
easy for them the app would have an option for them to make the order and pick it up, this would
remove the waiting time to make our service more efficient. Also if they prefer for their food to be
delivered, then this is something that we could cater for.

There are some problems that might occur in the creation of this app. Firstly, we are thinking of
internally developing the app. This requires us to have developers who have a good knowledge of
JAVA. Also, the running costs are quite high so if we don’t make a substantial amount of profit within
the first year, there is a chance that we might have to shut the app down.

## Accessibility, Navigation and Design

The design of the application plays a major role in its usability and frequency of usage. The goal is to end up with an application that is both usable for those who struggle with technological usage, and an application that gets used more frequently, which in turn brings in more customers which grows the business.

***Non-Functional Requirements:***

 - The design of the application should be simplistic
 - The application should support multiple languages (listed above)
 - The application should allow the user to contact the restaurant(s) via phone, email or a form
 - It should be easy and intuitive to use
 - The application should give a short vibration (tactile feedback) when an option is pressed (which can be turned off at any time)

#### Requirements

All of the functional and non-functional requirements were adhered to when designing the mobile application:

***Functional Requirements:***

 - The application must be able to display the menu - A menu button on the homescreen is featured which takes the user to the full menu in a scrollable list.
 - The application must be able to order a takeaway for delivery or collection - This can be done through the checkout screen of the application, which will then provide the user with an option to either order for delivery or takeaway. This can be done by tapping on the dedicated homescreen button labelled "checkout"
 - The application must be able to contact the restaurant (chain) - A separate button from the homescreen takes the user to a contact page, featuring the telephone number, email address, physical address and a contact form to fill in.
 - The application must be able to be used for booking a place in a restaurant at a given time - The last homescreen button takes the user to a booking screen, which features a calendar, where the user can simply tap on a date and then tap "OK" which will take them to a confirmation screen with a prompt asking for their name and specific time of booking.

***Non-Functional Requirements:***

 - The design of the application should be simplistic, easy and intuitive to use - The application features a common theme with a black background and an efficient use of space, with little to no cramping of features. The homescreen is logical and intuitive to use.
 - The application should support multiple languages (listed above) - A feature for language change has not been implemented for easier usability and simplicity of the application; the language changes itself automatically after detecting the area of where it is located.
 - The application should give a short vibration (tactile feedback) when an option is pressed (which can be turned off at any time) - This cannot be demonstrated by visual design of the application, but it is a feature that can easily be implemented with only a few lines of code in Java (Pseudo-code shown below):
 

       Def touched
       if object(touched)
		   vibrate once

For both the high and low fidelity designs, the user and software requirements listed above were kept in mind when they were implemented one by one. The most logical way to implement them all efficiently was to have a homescreen that branched off to meet all of the software requirements before applying the user/non-functional requirements. This method appeared to be extremely efficient. 
It was all completed in the design phase of the project.

#### Tools Used

For the creation of the low fidelity designs, pen and paper was used to draw them up. This was done to save time for spending on the high fidelity designs which were created on marvelapp.com

## Evaluation

In our group we decided that the best methodology to use was the waterfall model, below are all the stages:

 - *Requirements*  
 - *Design*
 - *Implementation* 
 - *Testing* 
 - *Maintenance*


From looking at the final design, we found that all the requirements were met. Due to us having great team working skills, this project was a massive success as we completed everything in a efficient manner. 

We wanted to complete this project efficiently, but making sure that it was up to a high standard. So Talvin, who was the team leader, allocated roles to myself and Adham so that we knew what part of the task we should concentrate on.  

Firstly, Talvin split the project overview into thirds, the project overview was important as it gave us an understanding of the whole project, that is why Talvin thought it was a good idea that we all contributed to this part of the project. Next, in the planning stage, Talvin allocated the tasks in chunks. 

Talvin worked on the Application Design and mentioned the Tools and Techniques that we needed for this project. I was allocated the the role of completing the Definition and Solution to the problem and Adham Ahmed drew up a Gantt chart for us to follow and the Target Audience and User Persona section.

By allocating roles like this we manged to complete the tasks in an efficent manner, but as we only had a few tasks to work on it was still up to a very high standard.
